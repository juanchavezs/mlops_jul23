# Testing Data Processing and Analysis

This repository contains a set of test scripts for verifying the correctness of data processing and analysis functions using the Python programming language. These tests ensure that the implemented functions behave as expected and produce the desired outcomes. The tests are organized into separate files for each specific area of functionality.
Test Scripts

The repository includes the following test scripts:

    test_data_existence.py: This script tests the existence and validity of the input data. It checks whether the required datasets or files are present and properly formatted.

    test_feature_generation.py: This script tests the feature generation function. It ensures that the new features generated are correct and meet the intended specifications.

    test_model_existence.py: This script tests the existence of trained models. It verifies whether the saved models exist in the designated directory and can be loaded successfully.

    test_remove_outliers.py: This script tests the outlier removal function. It validates whether the outliers are properly identified and removed, resulting in a clean dataset.

Running the Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

    Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

    Install the required dependencies using the following command:

    bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the desired test script using the following command:

bash

    python test_script_name.py

    Replace test_script_name.py with the actual name of the test script you want to run (e.g., test_data_existence.py).

    The test script will execute and provide output indicating whether the tests have passed or failed.
